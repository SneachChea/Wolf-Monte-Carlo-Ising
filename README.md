# Wolf-Monte-Carlo-Ising
## INTRODUCTION
Compute the magnetization of the Ising model for a 2D square lattice using Wolff algorithm.
This program also saves the (classic) state of the lattice at each temperature after thermalization. 
Those data would be useful for a new project. 

## DEPENDENCIES:
The script is tested with Python 3.5. 
Libraries used are:

* argparse: module allowing to write user-friendly command-line interfaces. Standard module in python.
* numpy: Package for scientific computing. Tested with version 1.13.0.
* os: Standard module in python.
* sys: Standard module in python.
